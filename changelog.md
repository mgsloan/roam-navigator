# roam-navigator changelog

## Version 5

* More muted color scheme for the visual hints.

## Version 4

* Update to the usage guide in the settings popup.

## Version 3

* Fixes input and block highlight deselection when `Alt+g` is used to
  trigger navigation mode.

## Version 2

* Small adjustments. Fixes a layout issue where the right sidebar
  content would slightly shift when navigation mode enabled.

## Version 1

* Initial release!  I am simultaneously very pleased with this
  extension, and mildly horrified by the amount of time I put into
  writing it. Please consider using it, so that my sacrifices are
  more worthwhile :)
